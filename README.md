**Typical appearance:**

Added option that allows me to define a custom header for each email.
With typical plugin, you can define a subject for the mail and the same text appears in the header of the email that the client receives.

Create a new field that allows me to define a custom header for each email, that accepts text and custom variables such as {order_number}, {order_date} custom variables already exist, it is not necessary to create them.

For example.

The subject of the mail would be:

{customer_name}, your payment details [Order # {order_id}]

Heading would be:

{customer_name}, thanks for your purchase...

**The customized plugin looks like below:**
